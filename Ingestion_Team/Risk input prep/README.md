# Risk Input Preparation – Gold Layer

## Objective
This step prepares basic healthcare risk indicators using existing

risk-ready inputs that can be consumed by analytics, dashboards,
or downstream ML models.

---

## Design Approach
- Rule-based logic
- Explainable calculations
- Uses analytics-ready Gold/Silver tables

---

## Status
