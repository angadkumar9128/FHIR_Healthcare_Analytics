# Risk Logic Explanation

Healthcare risk indicators are derived using simple, explainable rules.

## 1. Age-Based Risk
- Patients above a defined age threshold are flagged as higher risk

## 2. Encounter Frequency
- Patients with frequent hospital encounters are considered higher risk

## 3. Chronic Condition Indicator
- Presence of long-term conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)

## 4. Observation Volume
- High number of clinical observations may indicate ongoing treatment

## Why Rule-Based Risk
- Easy to validate
- Suitable for POC
- Clinically interpretable
- Can be replaced by ML models later
