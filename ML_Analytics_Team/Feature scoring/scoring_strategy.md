## Why Scoring Is Needed

Raw metrics (counts, costs, flags) vary in scale and meaning.
Scoring standardizes these into comparable signals.

## Scoring Principles

- Scores range from 0 to 100
- Higher score = higher risk or intensity
- Linear or threshold-based scoring
- No black-box transformations

## Scoring Methods Used

- Threshold-based scoring
