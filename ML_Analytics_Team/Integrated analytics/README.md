# ML Analytics – Integrated Analytics

## Objective
This module integrates ML Analytics outputs with existing Gold healthcare
analytics to create unified, intelligence-driven analytical datasets.

The goal is to enable:
- Risk-aware healthcare analytics
- Population-level insights
- Dashboard-ready datasets
- Business and clinical decision support

---

## What Is Being Integrated

Gold Analytics:
- Encounters
- Admissions
- Diseases
- Claims & costs

ML Analytics:
- Feature scores
- Risk scores
- Risk categories

---

## Integration Outcome

A single analytical view per patient that combines:
- Clinical activity
- Financial utilization
- Disease burden
- ML-based risk intelligence

---

## Why This Matters

Without integration:
- ML outputs stay isolated
- Dashboards lack context

With integration:
- Risk becomes actionable
- Analytics become intelligent
