# Reviewer Questions & Answers

### Q1. Why did you choose rule-based logic instead of ML models?

in healthcare. The design is ML-ready, allowing models to be added later
without changing the pipeline.

### Q2. Why does ML Analytics consume only Gold data?
Gold data is clean, stable, and business-aligned. This avoids schema volatility
and ensures consistent analytics and risk outputs.

### Q3. How do you ensure trust in risk scores?
Through validation rules, bounded scoring, explainable feature contributions,
and versioned logic.
