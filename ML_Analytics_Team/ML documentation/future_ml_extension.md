# Future ML Extension Strategy

## ML Readiness

Current design already provides:
- Clean numerical features
- Target variables
- Time-based snapshots

---

## Models That Can Be Added

- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Gradient boosting
- Neural networks

---

## Upgrade Path

Rule-based outputs can:
- Act as baseline models
- Be replaced by ML predictions
- Be used for supervised training

No pipeline redesign required.
