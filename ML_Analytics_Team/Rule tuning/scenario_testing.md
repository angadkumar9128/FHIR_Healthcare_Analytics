## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Increase utilization weight
- Expected impact: higher sensitivity to frequent visits

### Scenario 2: Tighten high-risk threshold
- Expected impact: fewer patients classified as high risk

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Risk distribution changes
- False positive reduction
- Stability across time windows
