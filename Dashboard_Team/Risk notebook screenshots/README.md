## 📸 Screenshots Captured (Not Committed)
The following screenshots were captured in Databricks
for validation and demo purposes but are **not committed to GitHub**:

1. Risk notebook overview and markdown explanation
2. Risk logic computation cells
3. Intermediate risk feature outputs
4. Final risk metrics table
5. Distribution of risk indicators

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Team Validated

### ✔ Risk Feature Availability
- All required input features exist
- No missing values in critical risk fields
- Data types are correct for scoring

### ✔ Logical Consistency
- Higher utilization aligns with higher risk
- Increased cost correlates with higher risk
- Chronic disease counts influence risk signals

### ✔ Output Readiness
- Risk outputs are patient-level
- Results are stable and repeatable
- Metrics are interpretable for dashboards

---

## 📊 Risk Metrics Used in Dashboards
Typical risk indicators visualized:
- High-risk patient counts
- Risk category distribution
- Risk vs cost correlation
- Risk vs utilization trends

These metrics enable:
- Proactive care management
- Resource prioritization
- Cost containment strategies

---

## 🧠 Why Risk Validation Matters
Incorrect risk outputs can:
- Misclassify patients
- Lead to poor clinical prioritization
- Reduce trust in analytics

Validating risk notebooks ensures dashboards
reflect **accurate and actionable insights**.

---

## 🚫 What Risk Notebooks Are NOT Used For
- No real-time scoring
- No model training in dashboards
- No ad-hoc experimentation
- No UI-level calculations

Dashboards only **consume final risk outputs**.

---

## 📊 Outcome of Risk Notebook Validation
✔ Risk logic reviewed  
✔ Outputs validated for completeness  
✔ Metrics aligned with dashboard needs  
✔ Ready for visualization  

---

## 📌 Status
**Risk Notebook Screenshots Documentation: ✅ Completed**

---

## 📝 Notes
Risk notebooks were visually inspected to ensure correctness,
interpretability, and readiness for dashboard consumption.
Documentation confirms that risk outputs are reliable, governed,
and suitable for business and clinical dashboards.
