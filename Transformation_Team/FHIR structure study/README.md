# FHIR Structure Study – Transformation Team

## Objective
Analyze the structure of FHIR JSON resources to understand nesting,
references, and relationships required for accurate transformation
into normalized Silver tables.

This study ensures transformation logic is:
- FHIR-compliant
- Reference-aware
- Analytics-ready

---

## Scope of Study
- Core clinical resources
- Administrative and financial resources
- Inter-resource references
- Nested JSON patterns

---

## Outcome
FHIR structures are fully understood and documented to support:
- Safe JSON flattening
- Clean Silver normalization
- Reliable Gold analytics

---

## Status
**Completed**

Review Note:
> FHIR JSON structures and relationships are clearly analyzed and
> documented to support downstream transformations.
